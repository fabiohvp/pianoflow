# 🎹 PianoFlow

## This project was my way of testing GEMINI AI capabilities. This was done almost all vibe coding.

A browser-based rhythm piano game inspired by Guitar Hero and VRTuos, built for beginners learning to play piano. Blocks fall from the top of the screen toward a hit line aligned with an interactive piano keyboard.

## Adding Songs

Add .mid or .midi files to the `static/musics/` directory then run `npm run create-db`. This will generate necessary JSON files in `static/database/`.

- Recommended repository with thousands of musics: 
  - https://github.com/lucasnfe/adl-piano-midi (general)
  - https://animezen.net/midis (animes)

## How to run locally

Execute `npm run dev -- --open` in the terminal and wait for browser to open and load.

- Suggestion: use it with a projector on top of the piano or with a screen bigger than your piano and try to position the screen inclined above the piano keyboard matching the keys on the screen with the piano keys (adjust keys amount and width as necessary). If you want to use with your TV you can use Port Forwarding and open in the browser or just mirror your screen.

## Features

1. **User-friendly interface**: Designed for beginners, PianoFlow includes intuitive controls and tutorials that guide players on how to play the game effectively.
2. **Customizable difficulty levels**: Players can adjust the speed of block falling to match their skill level.
3. **Customizable piano**: Players can adjust the number of keys and the width of the keys.
4. **Loop toggle**: Players can loop the song to play it again after it ends.
5. **Sound mode toggle**: Players can toggle between sound mode and music mode.
6. **Keyboard compact mode**: Players can toggle between compact and normal mode.
7. **Timeline**: Full-width bar. Players can scrub through the song to jump to any moment.

<!-- ### Controls

- **Mouse / Touch** — click or tap piano keys directly
- **QWERTY keyboard** — mapped to one octave starting at C4:

  | Key  | A   | W   | S   | E   | D   | F   | T   | G   | Y   | H   | U   | J   | K   | O   | L   | P   |
  | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Note | C4  | C#4 | D4  | D#4 | E4  | F4  | F#4 | G4  | G#4 | A4  | A#4 | B4  | C5  | C#5 | D5  | D#5 | -->

## Future

If this project end up getting popular I'll try adding a way to record the physical keyboard sound to check if user played right or wrong to give feedback and score.
